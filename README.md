The aim of the project is the application of Data Preparation Pipeline on a dirty dataset. We were assigned a dataset of medium-to-large scale retail business of the city of Milan. The dataset is freely available on Datiopen website at the following link: http://www.datiopen.it/it/opendata/Comune_di_Milano_Attivit_commerciali_di_media_e_grande_distribuzione                        
The repository contains: 
- the report with a detailed description of our work, 
- the Python code that you can execute in Google Colab,
- the cleaned dataset in .csv format
                      
If you want to execute the Python code in Colab, be sure to have the dataset .csv file in the same folder of the .ipynb file.
